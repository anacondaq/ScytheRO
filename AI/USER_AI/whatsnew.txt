-----------------
v1.2 (2006-12-02)
-----------------
- Full Long range mode (LONG_RANGE_SHOOTER option): the homunculus doesn't move and just shots bolts from far (Filir
  and Vanilmirth only).
- Tries to detect frozen or trapped monster, and mosters that have been hit by area spells (ADV_MOTION_CHECK option).
  This works with agressive monsters only and sometime it can give false positives, so it's optional (default = off).
  [devloped since experimental version 1.1.3 (2006-11-25)]
- Durations of Flitting, Accelerated Flight, Bulwark, and Urgent Escape are calculated automatically
- Movement protection, that filters any movement and prevents the homunculus to move out of range
- Other minor changes: improved working with turtles that do aid potion on other montsters. Improved skill temporization. Some minor fixes for PvP mods. The homunculus stops circling if a target is on
  sight. Revision of many functions and small optimizations. 

Updates:
- 1.2.2 (2006-12-22): added some checking even when "follow at once" option is disabled [thanks to dolseni for the suggestion] improved the movement protection filter.
- 1.2.1 (2006-12-17), first official v1.2 release: checked any new feature introduced in the test versions and done many fixes and fine tuning. Main fixes are: turtles casting potion pitcher and protected Move (if the homunculus was moving out of range, he/she then stopped at the current position, but if the current position was already out of range, it started an infinte Move call until you get a stak overflow. Now it works as intended and it returns in range) [special thanks to Maephis for testing]
- Test and Pre-Release versions: can work with obsolete configuration files, autocalc duration for some homunculus skills and better timings [thanks to Cain* for testing and suggestions], added protected Move [thanks to Isotta for feedbacks], testing for full long range mode, movements, friendly modes, and optimizations.

-----------------
v1.1 (2006-11-20)
-----------------
- In the tact list, you can disable alchemist auto attacks (AAA) for any monster to which they are ineffective.
  E.g.: if you are using a fireblend, you can set high orcs (that are fire monsters) as not a target for your
  firebolts. Else you can choose the level of your bolt for any kind of monster. Values are: -1 = OFF (no AAA),
  0 = standard level (the usual common value), 1..10 = skill level to use against this monster.
- Tomahawk throwing is supported
- Interception can be aided by alchemist bolts (BOLTS_ON_CHASE_ST option)

Updates:
- 1.1.1/.2 (2006-11-22/23): some anti bug-position workaround.

  is now an option (HELP_OWNER_1ST) [thanks to Kaliumcyanid for the suggestion], increased range tollerance for
  FOLLOW_AT_ONCE [thanks to Tsunami for the suggestion]
- 1.0 Beta 3 (2006-08-19): You can now configure the level of the homunculus and alchemist skills; Vanilmirth can
  now cast Caprice from far (long range); weapons bolt can be casted from far too; Auto Aid Potion can be casted in

  Some improvements to the follow mode [thanks to HauNix, Dispari Scuro, Kaliumcyanid, Love Story, and any other who
  tested Beta 2 and wrote feedbacks] moreover AAP now stops when you are out of potion; added an option to follow the
  alchemist at once, if he/she moves away during a battle. Vanilmirth can cast bolts while he does evasive maneuvers.
